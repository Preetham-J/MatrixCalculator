# MatrixCalculator
Here's a basic command line matrix calculator for those who want a fast and non-internet dependent tool! I decided to create this as many of my courses rely on various matrix calculations, which are very time consuming to do by hand.

# Currently Working
- Create matrices in a row-by-row fashion
- Store matrices by name
- View stored matrices
- Addition between stored matrices

# To Do
- All other computations (division, multiplication, subtraction)
- Computations with scalars
- Maybe a GUI
