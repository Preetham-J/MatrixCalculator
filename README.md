# MatrixCalculator
Here's a basic command line matrix calculator for those who want a fast and non-internet dependent tool! I decided to create this as many of my courses rely on various matrix calculations, which are very time consuming to do by hand.

# Currently Working
![alt text](/screenshots/main.png?raw=true "Main menu.")

- Create matrices in a row-by-row fashion
- Store matrices by name

![alt text](/screenshots/adding_matrix.png?raw=true "Adding matrices to the system.")
- View stored matrices

![alt text](/screenshots/view_system.png?raw=true "Viewing stored matrices.")
- Addition, subtraction, and multiplication between matrices
- Multiplication and division between matrices and scalars

# To Do
- Support multi-variable computations (currently only a single computation per line)
- Maybe a GUI
