# MatrixCalculator
Here's a basic command line matrix calculator for those who want a fast and non-internet dependent tool! I decided to create this project to explore the Eigen C++ library, as well as to create a fast tool that I could use for matrix calculations in many of my courses (which are time-consuming to do by hand).

# Currently Working
Main menu:

- Store matrices by name, and create them in a row-by-row fashion:

- View stored matrices:

- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division between matrices and/or scalars (where allowed):

# To Do
- Matrix transformations (eg. inverse, transpose)
- Maybe a GUI
